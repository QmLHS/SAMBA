Here, you will find the files included in the tutorial uploaded to the QIIME forum. These resources are provided to support and guide you through the tutorial steps.

First, install the environment using conda and this file [file].
Then, activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate q2-amplicon
```

To run the file, type:
* 'bash' for .sh files;
* 'python' for .py files;
* 'Rscript' for .R files.

Rscript bold_datapull_byGroup.R
bash check_duplicate_equal_taxon.sh
python plot_trimmed_and_untrimmed.py

**Method to avoid mistakes**
To avoid mistakes, simply place these files in the same folder as the project, so that no additional changes to paths that have not been hardcoded are required.
